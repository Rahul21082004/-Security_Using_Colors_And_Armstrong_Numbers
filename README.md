# -Security_Using_Colors_And_Armstrong_Numbers

Welcome to the repository for "Security Using Colors and Armstrong Numbers"! This project aims to provide a secure encryption and decryption mechanism using a combination of colors and Armstrong numbers. By leveraging the properties of colors and the mathematical concept of Armstrong numbers, this system ensures robust encryption of sensitive data.

### Overview

In today's digital world, ensuring the security of data transmission and storage is of paramount importance. Traditional encryption techniques often rely solely on mathematical algorithms, which can be susceptible to brute-force attacks. This project takes a unique approach by combining colors and Armstrong numbers to create a more secure encryption scheme.

### Features

- **Color-Based Encryption**: Data is encrypted by converting it into a sequence of colors based on predefined mappings.
- **Armstrong Number Generation**: Armstrong numbers are used as keys to further enhance the security of the encryption process.
- **Swing-based GUI**: The frontend interface is developed using Java Swing, providing a user-friendly experience for encryption and decryption tasks.
- **Dynamic HTML/CSS**: The frontend also includes HTML and CSS components for enhanced visualization of encrypted data.

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Java Swing, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Apache Tomcat Server 5.5
- **Database**: MySQL

### Encryption Process

1. **Color Mapping**: Each character of the input data is mapped to a specific color based on a predefined color palette.
2. **Armstrong Number Generation**: Armstrong numbers are generated dynamically and used as keys to encrypt the color sequence.
3. **Encryption**: The color sequence is encrypted using the generated Armstrong numbers.
4. **Output**: The encrypted data, along with the corresponding Armstrong numbers, is displayed to the user.

### Decryption Process

1. **Input**: The user provides the encrypted data and the corresponding Armstrong numbers.
2. **Decryption**: The encrypted data is decrypted using the provided Armstrong numbers.
3. **Color Reconstruction**: The decrypted data is mapped back to the original color sequence.
4. **Output**: The decrypted data is displayed to the user.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up Apache Tomcat Server 5.5 and MySQL database.
3. Configure the backend to connect to the MySQL database.
4. Build and deploy the frontend Java Swing application.
5. Access the application through a web browser to perform encryption and decryption tasks.

### Usage

Once installed, users can use the GUI interface to encrypt and decrypt their data securely. They can also customize the color palette and encryption parameters based on their preferences.
